Hello, my name is Korezo, I would love to learn the wide world of programming and computing on my own. 
Since I was little I have always felt attracted by technology, 
but those who directly rejected me for being different decided for me that I was not good for what I could only be a simple worker in the field, making me feel from a very young age that I would have no future. .
That's why now that I'm independent I'm fighting to show that people who are different can also achieve their goals.
